              <h2>WHATS MY NAME</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I have made my home base in Elk Grove, California with my lovely wife Cheryl. My journey into tech started when my stupid boss fired me fron Xerox. He was a fat ass slob. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs</p>
            </div>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

              <h2>Hand-Coded HTML</h2>
              <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

              <h2>Well-Organized CSS</h2>
              <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices</p>
